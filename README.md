# broadbandequity


**Technology:**
Data visualization, Python, Plotly, Pandas, Geographic Data

**Goals:**
We are looking to get creative in helping us map broadband disparities. 

- Census data is one resource we’d like to leverage further – whether creating heat maps, visualizing trends, or creating an interactive dashboard, there is potential to further bring data on inequities to light in an easy-to-use, digestible way. 

- What other ways can we define and demonstrate the digital divide? Some examples: Ookla speed test data can tell us the level of service different communities receive from their providers. FCC Form 477 data can show us where providers formally offer wired service. 

You will focus on: 
- Simply summarizing who has broadband at home and who doesn’t
- Determining why access is limited (is it an affordability or infrastructure problem?)
- Identifying what variables influence an individual’s likelihood of having broadband at home
- Data visualization and mapping (i.e., an interactive, easy-to-use dashboard bringing in data from various sources) 
- Short report summarizing trends

We are looking for support on compiling and mapping trends using various sources to paint a picture of broadband access.

**Milestones:**

- Data familiarization and preparation: Understand collection methodology, download data from different source and clean/align them
- Feature extraction: retrieve important features which are able to identify the broadband disparities
- Classification/Clustering: demonstrate the potential of distinguishing affordability or infrastructure problem in broadband access
- Spatial data science: incorporate spatial data to showcase the geopolitical and non-geographical relationships in broadband extent
- Data Visualization: create maps, plots, and dashboards (preferably interactive) to deliver the trends and insights
